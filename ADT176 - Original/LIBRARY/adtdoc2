Remove the four screws securingthe keyboard to the computer and move carefully to one side justenough to expose the four Rom sockets located on the right side of theboard. Insert ADT into one of the empty Rom sockets, with the littlenotch on the chip facing the back of the computer. Take care not tobend any of the legs on the chip. Replace the keyboard and top cover.To check the Rom has been properly inserted into the socket turn onthe power and type *HELP ADT. A list of commands should appear onthe screen. If no list  appears  it is likely the Rom is not correctlyin position. Check that all the legs of the Rom are in place and theRom is facing the right way.For the ElectronFor some ADT disc utilities to operate correctly in screen modes0,1,2 and 3 a small link, LK1 must be joined inside the Plus 3. Thismay invalidate the warranty on the Plus 3. If necessary see yourdealer.Checking LK1The link in the Plus 3 may already be joined. This can be checked byperforming the following procedure. First fit the Rom cartridge intothe Plus 1 as described below. With the computer turned on, selectscreen mode 0, by typing MODE 0, and then try verifying a disc, byinserting a formatted disc into the disc drive and typing *VERIFY.If the disc verifies OK then the link has already been joined, andnothing more need be done. If none of the tracks verify then the linkhas not been joined. If the disc verifies OK you will have noticed a'snow storm' effect on the screen while the disc drive is spinning.This will occur when some ADT disc utilities are used in screenmodes 0,1,2 and 3 and is confirmation that LK1 has been joined.ÄPEJoining LK1After turning off the power, isolate the Plus 3 by disconnecting thePlus 1 and Electron. Remove the top cover of the Plus 3, by unscrewingthe 9 fixing screws on the bottom of the Plus 3, shown in the diagrambelow.Locate LK1 situated to the top left of the disc drive between IC16 andIC10. If the link is not joined make the  connection  with a smallpiece of wire, ideally soldering it to the board. Replace the cover tothe Plus 3 and  re-connect  to  the Electron and Plus 1. Fit the Romcartridge to the Plus 1 as described below. To check the link has beenproperly joined follow the procedure above, 'Checking LK1'.Fitting the Rom cartridgeTurn off the power and insert the Rom cartridge into one of the slotsin the top of the Plus 1. Ensure the label on the cartridge faces thekeyboard. If in doubt refer to 'Using cartridges' on page 16 of thePlus 1 User Guide. To check that the cartridge has been properlyinsertedturn on the powerto the computer and type *HELP ADT. A  listof commands should appear on the screen. If no list appears it islikely the Rom cartridge is not correctly positioned in the Plus 1.Plus 3 showing which fixing screws to removeÄDH04  COMMAND SUMMARYÄPE*BACKUP	- copy one disc onto another*BFIND		- search a BASIC program for a string*BUILD		- create a text file*CATALL	- list filenames from the current directory*DCOMP		- compare two discs*DEX		- disc sector editor*DFIND		- search a disc for a string*DIRALL	- list directories fromthe current directory*DUMP		- display the contents of a file*ENVELOPE	- list the envelope definitions*FCOMP		- compare two files*FCOPY		- create a copy of a file*FORM		- initialise a new disc for reading and writing*FREE		- display the amount of free space on a disc*FSN		- identify the current filing system*KEYL		- list the function key definitions*LIST		- list a text file with line numbers*MAP		- display a map of the free space on a disc*MDUMP		- display the contents of memory*MENU		- select a program from a menu for execution*MEX		- memory editor*MFIND		- seach memory for a string*MLOAD		- load a program to a specific memory address*MOVE		- move a block of memory*MRUN		- run a program at a specific memory address*ROMS		- catalogue the sideways Rom sockets*SECTORS	- read or write sectors onto a disc*SETADR	- change a file's load and execution addresses*SPT           - change the default sectors per track*SWAP          - swap catalogues on a dual catalogue disc*TYPE		- list a text file without line numbers*UNPLUG	- turn off a Rom*VERIFY	- verify a disc for legibility*XFER		- transfer files between two filing systems
