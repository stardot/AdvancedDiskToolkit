€HM0€FM0€CEADT€CEThe Advanced Disc ToolkitADT is a powerful utility ROM for disc and non-disc users. It containsover 30 useful commands considered to be the most important utilities forany system. It has the intelligence to work in any filing system, such asTAPE, DFS, ADFS, or ECONET and also with any Acorn machine, such as BBC B,B+, Electron, and Master Series.ADT features commands to format and verify discs in both DFS and ADFS anda disc sector editor to alter any sector on a disc. Lost files can berecovered with another command which will read or write sectors from adisc without the use of a catalogue. Files can be transferred from onefiling system to another, eg with one command all files on TAPE could betransferred to DISC, including LOCKED files, or even files held on a DFSdisc could be transferred to an ADFS disc, or vice versa.A menu command allows file and directory names from disc to be listed ontothe screen and a pointer can be moved around the screen to select andautomatically load or run a particular file, even below PAGE or insideways RAM. If the entry is a directory, then the files from thatdirectory will be listed onto the screen. Other keys can be pressed toreturn back to the previous directory, to enter the parent directory or to enter the root directory. In this way, any file in any directory can befound and run very easily.ADT also contains a very powerful memory editor and disassembler. Thiscommand can display memory in any screen mode and in a number of differentformats, such as ascii, hexadecimal, 65C102 disassembler or a combinationof ascii and hexadecimal. Memory can be examined from normal IO memoryincluding the sideways ROMs as well as memory from a second processor orco-processor, such as the 6502, Z80, 32016 or 80186.ADT contains many other commands including commands to load or run filesbelow PAGE, load files into sideways RAM, to change a files load/executionaddresses, to move memory from one address to another, to search a BASICprogram,  memory or a disc for a string, to display the free and usedspace and files on a disc, to compare two discs or files,  to list thefunction key and envelope definitions, to list the sideways  ROMs and tounplug sideways ROMs.ADT is fully compatible with:					* BBC B, B+, Electron, Master Series		* 6502, Z80, 32016 Second Processors               * 65C102, 80186 Co-Processors		* DFS 0.90, DNFS 1.20, 1770 DFS, ADFS, ECONET                 (including fully Acorn compatible DFS's)		* Acorn Winchester hard disc               * Shadow RAMVery well received by the media, reviewers and users:"Take a close look at ADT - it's superb" - Database Publications."This ROM is an absolute winner!" - Viewfax Tubelink - PRESTEL."It's excellent value for money" - Acorn User."It has just about every utility you're likely to need" - Database Pub."It is superb - it gets 10 out of 10" - Professional user, London."Is extremely versatile and handles the ROMs & TUBE better thananything else I know" - Business user, Wilts."Delighted with the facilities in ADT" - Surrey user.€CEAdvanced Computer Products Limited€CE6 Ava House, High Street, Chobham, Surrey.
